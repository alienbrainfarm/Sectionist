# Product Requirements Document (PRD) — Sectionist

## Overview

**Sectionist** is a macOS application designed for musicians and music learners. It analyzes a song’s audio file and provides a structured overview of the song, automatically segmenting it into sections (e.g., intro, verse, chorus), detecting key changes, and mapping out basic chords. The application leverages a SwiftUI frontend for native Mac experience and a Python backend for music information retrieval (MIR) and machine learning (ML) processing.

## Problem Statement

Learning new songs is time-consuming for musicians, especially when breaking down song structure, keys, and chords by ear. Existing tools focus on either transcription or chord recognition, but few offer a comprehensive, easy-to-use solution for mapping out song sections and harmonic structure directly from audio.

---

## Goals

- Provide musicians with a fast, intuitive way to visualize and understand song structure.
- Lower the technical barrier for analyzing audio to extract musical information.
- Enable local, private processing for user data (no cloud uploads).

---

## Features

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

1. **Song Section Segmentation**
   - Users can load an audio file (mp3, wav, etc.).
   - The app automatically segments the song into major sections (intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro, etc.).
   - Visual timeline displaying sections with labels and timestamps.

2. **Key Detection**
   - Display the detected key of the song.
   - Indicate key changes throughout the timeline (if present).

3. **Chord Mapping (Basic)**
   - Map out basic chords for each section or bar.
   - Display chord labels on the timeline.

### Future Enhancements

- **Lyric Extraction**
  - Extract lyrics from vocal audio (using speech-to-text).
- **Export Options**
  - Export structure, chords, and lyrics as PDF, text, or MIDI.
- **Advanced Chord Detection**
  - Support for more complex harmonies and chord extensions.
- **User Annotation**
  - Allow users to manually adjust or annotate detected sections/chords.
- **Integration**
  - Integrate with DAWs or music notation software.

## User Stories

1. **As a musician, I want to drop an audio file into Sectionist and quickly see the song structure, so I can start learning the parts faster.**
2. **As a user, I want to see the key and chord changes along the timeline, so I can practice the song accurately.**
3. **As a singer, I want to extract lyrics from a song, so I can rehearse without searching for lyrics online.**
4. **As a teacher, I want to export the analyzed structure for my students.**

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend (SwiftUI)
- macOS app with drag-and-drop or file picker for audio.
- Timeline view showing labeled song sections.
- Display of detected key and chords.
- Responsive UI for analysis progress and errors.

### Backend (Python)
- Audio analysis using MIR/ML libraries (e.g., librosa, madmom, Essentia).
- Song segmentation, key detection, chord estimation.
- REST (localhost HTTP) or IPC interface for SwiftUI to call backend.
- Local inference (no external API calls).

### Data Handling
- All processing is local to the user's machine.
- Support common audio formats: MP3, WAV, AIFF, etc.

---

## Success Metrics

- User can load a song and see section labels in under 30 seconds.
- Section segmentation accuracy: >75% match to human labeling (measured on test set).
- Key detection accuracy: >80% on test set.
- Chord mapping: basic root and quality correct on >70% of bars in pop/rock music.

## Milestones & Timeline

1. **Project Setup & Scaffolding** (Week 1)
   - Repo, SwiftUI/Python folders, initial README, sample audio file(s).

2. **Basic Song Segmentation** (Weeks 2–4)
   - Backend prototype for section detection.
   - SwiftUI frontend to visualize segments.

3. **Key & Chord Detection** (Weeks 5–6)
   - Add key and chord estimation to backend.
   - Update UI to display results.

4. **User Experience Polish** (Weeks 7–8)
   - Progress indicators, error handling, UI refinement.

5. **Testing & Docs** (Weeks 8–9)
   - Test with various genres and files.
   - User guide and FAQ.

6. **Beta Release** (Week 10)

---

## Dependencies & Risks

- Availability of suitable open-source models for segmentation, key, and chord detection.
- Performance on longer or complex songs.
- Handling edge cases (e.g., live recordings, medleys).
- User privacy: ensure no data leaves device.

---

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- Real-time/live audio analysis.
- Cloud processing.
- Mobile (iOS) version.
- Advanced music theory features (e.g., custom tuning, tempo mapping).
