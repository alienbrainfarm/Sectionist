# Quick Start Guide: Improving Sectionist's Segmentation Accuracy

## TL;DR - How to Improve Segmentation from 58% to 80%+

Current state: **58.5% boundary detection accuracy, 68.3% label accuracy**

**Phase 1 (Immediate - 2 weeks)**: Integrate MSAF
- Add `pip install msaf` to requirements
- Expected improvement: **58% → 75%** boundary accuracy
- Minimal code changes, proven algorithms

**Phase 2 (Medium-term - 4 weeks)**: Local LLM Enhancement  
- Install Ollama + Mistral 7B model
- Expected improvement: **75% → 85%** overall accuracy
- Maintains privacy, no cloud dependencies

**Phase 3 (Long-term - 8 weeks)**: Custom Deep Learning
- Train specialized models on music datasets
- Expected improvement: **85% → 90%+** accuracy
- Professional-grade results

## Immediate Action Items

### 1. Test MSAF Integration (30 minutes)

```bash
cd backend/
source venv/bin/activate
pip install msaf

# Test MSAF
python3 -c "
import msaf
import librosa

# Create test audio
y, sr = librosa.load(librosa.ex('brahms'))
boundaries, labels = msaf.process(y, sr=sr, boundaries_id='sf', labels_id='cnmf')
print(f'Detected {len(boundaries)} boundaries: {boundaries}')
"
```

### 2. Setup Ollama for LLM Integration (15 minutes)

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Download lightweight model  
ollama pull mistral:7b  # 4.1GB download

# Test LLM
ollama run mistral:7b "Analyze this music pattern: high energy at 0-20s, low energy 20-40s, high energy 40-60s. What song sections could this be?"
```

### 3. Quick Accuracy Benchmark (10 minutes)

```bash
cd backend/
python3 test_advanced_segmentation.py
```

Current baseline: Look for lines like:
```
Average Boundary Accuracy: 58.5%
Average Label Accuracy: 68.3%
```

## Implementation Priority

| Approach | Time Investment | Expected Improvement | Risk Level |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| MSAF Integration | 2 weeks | +17% accuracy | Low - proven algorithms |
| Ollama LLM | 4 weeks | +10% accuracy | Medium - new technology |
| Custom ML | 8+ weeks | +5% accuracy | High - requires ML expertise |

## Quick Wins

1. **Enable MSAF fallback**: If current algorithm fails, try MSAF
2. **Ensemble voting**: Average results from multiple algorithms
3. **Confidence thresholds**: Only use new methods when confident
4. **User feedback**: Learn from manual corrections

## Code Changes Required

**Minimal MSAF Integration** (~50 lines):
```python
# In example.py
def analyze_audio_file(audio_file):
    # Try improved algorithm first
    if IMPROVED_SEGMENTATION_AVAILABLE:
        result = improved_analyze_song_structure(...)
        if len(result.get('sections', [])) >= 3:
            return result
    
    # Fallback to MSAF
    try:
        import msaf
        boundaries, labels = msaf.process(audio_file, boundaries_id="sf")
        return format_msaf_results(boundaries, labels)
    except ImportError:
        pass
    
    # Original algorithm as final fallback
    return original_analyze_song_structure(...)
```

## Success Metrics

- **Boundary Detection**: Target 80%+ (vs current 58.5%)
- **Label Accuracy**: Target 85%+ (vs current 68.3%)
- **Processing Time**: Keep under 30s for 4-minute songs
- **User Satisfaction**: Measure through feedback/corrections

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Implement MSAF integration and benchmark
2. **Week 2**: Setup Ollama infrastructure and basic LLM prompts
3. **Week 3**: Develop hybrid algorithm selection logic
4. **Week 4**: User testing and feedback collection
