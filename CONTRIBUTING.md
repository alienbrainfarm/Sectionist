## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment. Please be kind and constructive in all interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start contributing, make sure you have:

- **macOS** (required for SwiftUI development)
- **Xcode 14+** with command line tools
- **Python 3.8+** 
- **Git** for version control
- Basic familiarity with Swift/SwiftUI and Python

### First Time Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Sectionist.git
   cd Sectionist
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/alienbrainfarm/Sectionist.git
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features (when created)
- `feature/issue-name` - Feature branches
- `bugfix/issue-name` - Bug fix branches
- `docs/issue-name` - Documentation-only changes

### Workflow Steps

1. **Sync with upstream**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** (see sections below)

4. **Test your changes** thoroughly

5. **Commit with clear messages**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add song segmentation algorithm"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Frontend (SwiftUI)

The frontend is a macOS SwiftUI application. Currently, the Xcode project structure is being planned.

1. **Once the Xcode project exists**:
   ```bash
   cd Sectionist/  # The SwiftUI project directory
   open Sectionist.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Build and run** in Xcode (âŒ˜+R)

### Backend (Python)

The backend handles audio processing and machine learning inference.

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   cd backend/
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (when requirements.txt exists):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install black flake8 pytest mypy
   ```

### Audio Processing Dependencies

The backend will likely use these libraries:
- `librosa` - Audio analysis
- `numpy` - Numerical computing  
- `scipy` - Scientific computing
- `scikit-learn` - Machine learning
- `madmom` - Audio processing (optional)

### Areas for Contribution

1. **Audio Analysis** - Song segmentation, key detection, chord recognition
2. **SwiftUI Frontend** - User interface, file handling, visualization
3. **Integration** - Communication between frontend and backend
4. **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests
5. **Documentation** - User guides, API documentation
6. **Performance** - Optimization, caching, memory management

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Fill out the PR template** (when available)
2. **Write a clear title** describing the change
3. **Include tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Keep PRs focused** - one feature/fix per PR
6. **Reference related issues** using keywords like "Fixes #123"

### PR Review Process

1. Automated checks must pass (linting, tests)
2. At least one maintainer review required
3. All conversations must be resolved
4. PR is merged using squash-and-merge

## Code Style

### Swift/SwiftUI

- Follow standard Swift conventions
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Use SwiftUI best practices for state management

Example:
```swift
/// Analyzes audio file and returns song sections
func analyzeSong(from url: URL) async throws -> SongAnalysis {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Python

- Follow **PEP 8** style guide
- Use **Black** for formatting:
  ```bash
  black src/ tests/
  ```
- Use **flake8** for linting:
  ```bash
  flake8 src/ tests/
  ```
- Add type hints where appropriate:
  ```python
  def segment_audio(audio_data: np.ndarray, sample_rate: int) -> List[Segment]:
      """Segment audio into meaningful sections."""
      pass
  ```

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding/updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Example: `feat: implement basic song segmentation algorithm`

## Testing

### Frontend Testing

- Use XCTest for unit tests
- Test UI components where appropriate
- Mock backend interactions

### Backend Testing

- Use **pytest** for testing:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/
  ```
- Write unit tests for all analysis functions
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Test with various audio formats and edge cases

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >80% test coverage
- Focus on critical paths and edge cases
- Include performance tests for audio processing

## Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports

Include:
- Operating system version
- Xcode version (for frontend issues)
- Python version (for backend issues)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Audio file details (format, length, genre) if relevant

### Feature Requests

Include:
- Clear description of the feature
- Use case and motivation
- Proposed implementation approach (if any)
- Mockups or examples (if applicable)

### Questions

- Check existing documentation first
- Search existing issues
- Use descriptive titles
- Provide context for your question

## Getting Help

- **Issues**: For bugs and feature requests
- **Discussions**: For questions and general discussion
- **Discord/Slack**: [Link when available]
