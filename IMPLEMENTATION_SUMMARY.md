# Audio Playback Feature - Implementation Status

## üéµ Current State

The Sectionist project has **transitioned from Swift to Python frontend** for cross-platform compatibility. The audio playback functionality is now implemented in the Python frontend using pygame.

### üéØ What's Implemented

#### Python Frontend (Current Active Development)
```
[Song Section Blocks in Timeline - CLICKABLE FOR SEEKING]
     Intro    |    Verse 1    |    Chorus    
   [‚ñ∂Ô∏è] ‚Üê Plays audio using pygame

Enhanced Controls:
[‚è™] [‚ñ∂Ô∏è/‚è∏Ô∏è] [‚è©]  [Progress Display]
Skip   Play    Skip   Current Time
Back   Pause   Forward  / Duration
```

#### Swift Frontend (Archived)
The original Swift implementation with AVFoundation has been moved to `Swift-frontend-archived/` for reference. It included:
- Native macOS audio playback with AVFoundation
- Advanced seeking and timeline scrubbing
- Professional audio controls

**Why the change?** The Python implementation provides cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux) while the Swift version was limited to macOS only.

### üíª Technical Architecture

#### Current Python Implementation (sectionist_gui.py)
- **PyQt6 Integration**: Cross-platform GUI framework
- **pygame Audio**: Cross-platform audio playback
- **Key Methods**: play(), pause(), stop(), load_audio()
- **UI Integration**: Timeline visualization with section clicking
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux

#### Archived Swift Implementation (AudioPlayerService.swift)
- **AVFoundation Integration**: Native macOS audio playback (archived)
- **ObservableObject**: SwiftUI reactive updates (archived)
- **Advanced Features**: Advanced seeking, speed control (archived)
- **Platform Limitation**: macOS only (reason for archival)

#### User Experience Flow
1. **Load Audio File** ‚Üí Drag & drop or "Browse..." button
2. **Optional Analysis** ‚Üí "Analyze Audio" for section detection
3. **Play Audio** ‚Üí Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button for immediate playback (pygame)
4. **Interactive Control** ‚Üí Basic playback controls
5. **Section Navigation** ‚Üí Click colored sections to view analysis (seeking in development)

### üß™ Validation & Testing

#### Current Python Frontend Status
- ‚úÖ Backend server communication: WORKING
- ‚úÖ Audio format support (MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, etc.): VERIFIED
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility: WINDOWS/MACOS/LINUX
- ‚úÖ PyQt6 GUI integration: COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Feature completeness: BASIC PLAYBACK IMPLEMENTED
- ‚úÖ Timeline integration: CONNECTED
- üîÑ Advanced seeking: IN DEVELOPMENT

#### Archived Swift Frontend (Reference)
- ‚úÖ Integration test results were successful
- ‚úÖ All audio formats supported
- ‚úÖ Swift syntax validation passed
- ‚úÖ Advanced features were fully implemented
- ‚ùå Platform limitation: macOS only (reason for archival)

#### Supported Audio Formats
```json
{
  "supported_formats": [
    "mp3", "wav", "aiff", "m4a", "flac", 
    "ogg", "aac", "opus", "wma"
  ]
}
```

### üì± User Interface Changes

#### Current Python Frontend
- **Play Button**: Functional with pygame audio playback
- **Timeline Display**: Shows song sections and analysis results
- **File Loading**: Drag & drop or browse button
- **Progress Display**: Shows current playback status
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Error Messages**: Clear feedback for any issues

#### Archived Swift Frontend Features (For Reference)
- **Advanced Timeline Slider**: Scrub to any position during playback (archived)
- **Skip Controls**: ‚è™ 10s backward, ‚è© 10s forward (archived)
- **Speed Menu**: 0.5x, 0.75x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 2x options (archived)
- **Precise Seeking**: Click sections to jump to exact audio position (archived)

### üìã How to Test

#### For Developers (Current Python Frontend)
1. Start the backend: `cd backend && ./start_server.sh`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && source venv/bin/activate && python sectionist_gui.py`
3. Drag an audio file into the app
4. Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è play button - audio should play using pygame
5. Test analysis by clicking "Analyze Audio"

#### For Users (Current Application)
1. Launch Sectionist Python app
2. Load your audio file (drag & drop or browse)
3. **NEW**: Click play to hear your music!
4. **NEW**: Analyze audio to see song sections
5. **NEW**: Cross-platform support (Windows/macOS/Linux)

#### Archived Swift Version (For Reference)
The Swift version included more advanced features like precise seeking and speed controls, but was limited to macOS only. The code remains in `Swift-frontend-archived/` for reference.

### üîß Implementation Details

#### Current Code Structure
- **Main File**: `frontend/sectionist_gui.py` (PyQt6 implementation)
- **Audio Backend**: pygame for cross-platform audio playback
- **GUI Framework**: PyQt6 for native cross-platform widgets
- **Communication**: HTTP API with existing Python backend
- **Documentation**: `frontend/README.md` - Complete setup instructions

#### Archived Code (Reference Only)
- **Archived File**: `Swift-frontend-archived/AudioPlayerService.swift` (274 lines)
- **Archived UI**: `Swift-frontend-archived/TimelineView.swift` - Advanced timeline
- **Archived Project**: `Swift-frontend-archived/Sectionist.xcodeproj`
- **Documentation**: `docs/AUDIO_PLAYBOOK.md` - Swift implementation details

#### Key Features Comparison
```python
# Current Python capabilities
audio_player.load_audio(file_path)      # Load file
audio_player.play()                     # Play audio
audio_player.pause()                    # Pause audio  
audio_player.stop()                     # Stop audio
# Cross-platform support included

# Archived Swift capabilities (reference)
# audioPlayer.seek(to: timeInSeconds)   # Advanced seeking (archived)
# audioPlayer.setPlaybackRate(1.5)     # Speed control (archived)
# audioPlayer.skipBackward/Forward()   # Skip controls (archived)
```

### üöÄ Result

**The audio playback feature is implemented in the current Python frontend.** Users can load audio files and play them directly within the cross-platform application. While the current implementation provides basic playback functionality, the focus has shifted to:

1. **Cross-platform compatibility** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
2. **Unified development environment** - All Python ecosystem
3. **Easier maintenance and contribution** - No platform-specific tools required

**Future Enhancements:**
- Enhanced seeking functionality (upgrading from pygame to QtMultimedia)
- Advanced playback controls (speed adjustment, precise timeline scrubbing)
- Section-based navigation improvements

The archived Swift implementation demonstrated advanced audio features and remains available for reference in `Swift-frontend-archived/`. The Python implementation prioritizes accessibility and cross-platform support while maintaining core functionality.
