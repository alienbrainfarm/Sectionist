# Sectionist

Sectionist is a macOS application that helps musicians analyze songs by splitting audio into meaningful sections (intro, verse, chorus, etc.), detecting key changes, and mapping basic chords. The app uses a SwiftUI frontend and a local Python backend for audio/ML processing.

**Planned Features:**
- Song structure segmentation (intro, verse, chorus, etc.)
- Key and key change detection
- Basic chord mapping
- (Future) Lyric extraction from audio

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Swift/SwiftUI (macOS app)
- **Backend:** Python (audio processing & ML inference)

## Directory Structure

- `Sectionist/` — SwiftUI macOS app (Xcode project)
- `backend/` — Python backend for music analysis

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/alienbrainfarm/Sectionist.git
   cd Sectionist
   ```
2. **Requirements:**
   - macOS, Xcode (for Swift/SwiftUI)
   - Python 3.x (for backend)

3. **Running the App:**
   - (Instructions coming soon)

## Roadmap
- [ ] Song section detection (MVP)
- [ ] Key/chord detection
- [ ] Lyric extraction (future)
- [ ] Enhanced GUI
